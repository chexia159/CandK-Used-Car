# CandK-Used-Car
'''
This is a project that specializes in comparing used car prices in one very same model but between two different regions (China & Korea). It totally consists of 3 parts i.e. crawling, data cleaning, and data mining. After calculating the regression models for both countries in one very similar trim, it concluded that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, implying Chinese used car price has an insignificant difference from Korean car price in terms of one similar trim in the same model.
